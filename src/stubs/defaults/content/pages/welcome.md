# Welcome to VelvetCMS Core

Congratulations! You have successfully installed VelvetCMS Core.

## Getting Started

While VelvetCMS Core is a Content Application Framework, it still can work as a simple flat-file CMS out of the box. That means you don't need a database to manage your content.

1.  **Edit this page:** Open `user/content/pages/welcome.md` in your editor.
2.  **Create a new page:** Create a new Markdown file in `user/content/pages/`.
3.  **Customize your views:** Check out `user/views/`.
